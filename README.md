## Abstract
CS344 Operating Systems I Portfolio - Project

In this assignment you will write smallsh your own shell in C. smallsh will implement a subset of features of well-known shells, such as bash. Your program will

- Provide a prompt for running commands
- Handle blank lines and comments, which are lines beginning with the # character
- Provide expansion for the variable $$
- Execute 3 commands exit, cd, and status via code built into the shell
- Execute other commands by creating new processes using a function from the exec family of functions
- Support input and output redirection
- Support running commands in foreground and background processes
- Implement custom handlers for 2 signals, SIGINT and SIGTSTP

## How To Use

### Installation
#### C Program
```
	chmod +x compile.sh
	./compile.sh
```
#### Test script
```
	chmod +x p3testscript
	./p3testscript
```
### Format Input
```
    : command [arg1 arg2 ...] [< input_file] [> output_file] [&]
```
- Command will be able to replicate most shell commands.
- Arguments may be placed into the front of the command
- Redirections of input/output are possible for single file only.
- & toggles foreground use of programs only.
    
### exit
```
    : exit
```
- Terminates all background processes and returns to the main terminal of the directory.

### cd
```
    : cd [desired directory path]
```
- Without an argument, the program will return the user to the home directory
- Go to a path through only the first argument after cd.

### status:
```
    : status
```
- Will print the status of the last process if it was terminated normally or through a signal.

### Redirection:
```
	: < input.txt > output.txt
```
- Files may be redirected following the format input above.

### ^c or ctrl+c:
```
	: ^c
```
- Terminates a foreground process and display the signal it was terminated with.
- This will not affect background processes.

### ^z or ctrl+z:
```
	: ^z
```
- Toggles between background processes being allowed or foreground processes only.
